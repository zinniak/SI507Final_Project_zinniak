## Project Description
This is a Flask application that shows details about the top 50 music tracks on the music platform Last.fm. The home shows details about each of the tracks. There is a route to look at the list of all the artists that have songs in the Last.fm top 50 tracks list. Another route shows bar charts of the number of listeners and play count each of these artists have on Last.fm. Users can click on each artistâ€™s name on the artist details route to see their picture. Users can also click on a navigation bar to navigate through the different routes.

## How to run
1.  First, you should install requirement with `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
2.  Second, you should run the `SI507project_tools.py` file to create the necessary files for the Flask application to run.
3.  To run the Flask application, type `python SI507project_app.py runserver` in the command prompt.
4. The application will begin running, open up a tab in a web-browser and type the following in the URL bar: `127.0.0.1:5000`. This will take you to the home page of the route with a list of the top 50 artists on Last.fm.
